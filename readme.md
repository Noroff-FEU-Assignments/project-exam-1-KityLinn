# Just Another Gamer Girl
With this project I was tasked with creating a blog website, deciding on a gaming themed blog. The content of the website is dynamically generated using posts from wordpress fetched as an API. This was done using html and css to create the base of the website and then javascript to fetch and render the dynamic content.

It contains:

- main page
- posts page
- single post page
- about me page
- contact me page

## Description

The project is a gaming blog website designed to appeal to a young adult video game playing audience. The blog fucuses on news related to video games. It is designed to be responsive across most screen sizes as well as mobile devices.
It uses dynamically generated content fetched from a wordpress API where the posts are created and the relevat date is fetched using javascript.

The website also contains a slider and post pages for each individual blog post dynamically generated.
